[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]: me.lucko.luckperms.bukkit.vault.ServerThreadLookupException: A Vault API request has been made on the main server thread that LuckPerms cannot safely respond to.
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]: This is NOT a bug - please do not report it to LuckPerms.
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]: Instead, please carefully read the information given below.
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]: 
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]: LuckPerms cannot respond to the request because to do so:
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]: - it needs to lookup user data for '8bfc879a-00f2-4ecd-b6e6-1383339458b0' (an offline player) from the database
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]: 
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]: Performing this lookup on the main server thread would cause your server to lag.
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]: There are two solutions to this problem:
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]:   a) Ask the author of the plugin making the request to perform Vault calls for
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]:      offline players "asynchronously" (using the scheduler). Additionally, prefer
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]:      using the methods that accept 'Player' or 'OfflinePlayer' instead of usernames.
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]:      You should be able to identify the plugin making the request in the trace below.
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]:   b) As a server admin, you can disable this exception by setting 'vault-unsafe-lookups'
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]:      to true in the LuckPerms configuration file. However, please use this only as
[00:03:49] [Server thread/WARN]:      a last resort.
